# AI Tools for Business – Workshop Packages

Save time, cut costs, and reach more customers. Our workshops show businesses how to use AI to get real results fast — from sharper copy and smarter marketing to streamlined operations and product improvements.

---

Our AI workshops give SMEs the tools and confidence to use AI effectively in day-to-day work. Designed for councils, enterprise agencies, and sector bodies, each package blends clear demonstrations, guided practice, and one-to-one mentoring. With options from £1,200, organisations can deliver high-impact support that is practical, accessible, and results-driven. Now is the right moment to act — AI adoption is accelerating, and local businesses risk being left behind without the right guidance.
