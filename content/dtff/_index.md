# DTFF Application Support – Northern Ireland

The **Digital Transformation Flexible Fund (DTFF)** offers **Northern Ireland SMEs between £5,000 and £20,000** to invest in advanced digital technologies such as AI, data, and process automation. But competition is intense, and funding calls close quickly. A small mistake or weak alignment with DTFF criteria can mean losing out.

At **Flax & Teal**, we provide **specialist DTFF application support** to help you strengthen, refine, or fully manage your submission. Our team has already supported SMEs across all 11 Council areas to prepare **compliant, fundable applications** that meet assessor expectations.
