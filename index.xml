This has involved site visits, workshops and detailed data modelling exercises, and has been supported on the technology side by Kubernetes, Python-in-the-cloud, Ray data workflows and deployed to GKE.</description></item><item><title>Maritime Mile</title><link>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/maritime-mile/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 10:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/maritime-mile/</guid><description>Explore Belfastâ€™s Maritime Mile History Like Never Before Welcome to the Virtual Heritage Experience Dive into the past with an innovative way to explore historical images, videos, audio clips, and captivating stories from heritage archives.
