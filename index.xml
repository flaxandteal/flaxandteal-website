This involved interviewing a range of researchers, from social scientists to geologists, to establish a common base of requirements, and ensuring UKRI (UK Research and Innovation) compliant documentation and data management.
Tomorrow‚Äôs Cities is being conducted with a range of institutions in Scotland, Nepal, Kenya and Turkey and, indirectly, governmental stakeholders to inform risk management for urban disaster planning globally.</description></item><item><title>Arches for Heritage</title><link>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/arches-heritage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 10:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/arches-heritage/</guid><description>Arches for Cultural Heritage Institutions We are currently in the process of delivering a long-term digital transformation project for Northern Irish public sector, migrating all of their current and historic heritage- based data to a customised Arches HER (Historic Environment Record) instance.

While all sectors are now indirectly dependent on open source projects, uptake has been far slower outside IT, at least outside major international innovation hubs.
We believe this is due to a traditional view of IP and technology business value, that is being superseded, driven by the realisable net business benefit to procuring open source solutions in all sectors, and proven case studies in AI, cloud, automation, IoT and automotive.</description></item><item><title>Terms and Conditions</title><link>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/terms-and-condition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2023 14:10:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/terms-and-condition/</guid><description>Introduction Welcome to Flax and Teal&amp;rsquo;s website.
