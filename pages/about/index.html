Our Director, Phil Weir, spent over 3 years completing his PhD in New Zealand, a whopping 11,468 miles from his roots in Northern Ireland. Turns out, Northern Ireland and New Zealand have more in common than one would think.
<em>Flax</em> is a flowering plant which grows natively both in NI and NZ, whereas <em>Teal</em> is a species of duck (no, really), which is also natively found in both regions. Our name broadly summarises our viewpoint as a company; looking both at home and away.
Although we are a small company, our team currently spans across 7 countries, and is something we are passionate about growing. While we are locally based in Belfast, it doesn&rsquo;t stop us from acquiring talent around the world. This focus also applies to our customer base, we don&rsquo;t believe in being confined to just one market.</p></div></div><div id=pg2-footer><strong>Flax & Teal Limited</strong> is a limited company registered in Northern Ireland, at Farset Labs, Weavers Court, Linfield Road, Belfast, BT12 5GH, with registration number <a href=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/NI617545>NI617545</a>, VAT number GB283-7116-92, EORI number GB283711692000, and ICO registration ZA243895.</div></div></div></body></html>
