This involved interviewing a range of researchers, from social scientists to geologists, to establish a common base of requirements, and ensuring UKRI (UK Research and Innovation) compliant documentation and data management.
Tomorrow’s Cities is being conducted with a range of institutions in Scotland, Nepal, Kenya and Turkey and, indirectly, governmental stakeholders to inform risk management for urban disaster planning globally.</description></item><item><title>Arches for Heritage</title><link>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/arches-heritage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 10:41:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flaxandteal.co.uk/pages/arches-heritage/</guid><description>Arches for Cultural Heritage Institutions We are currently in the process of delivering a long-term digital transformation project for Northern Irish public sector, migrating all of their current and historic heritage- based data to a customised Arches HER (Historic Environment Record) instance.
