From the early stages of the projects, Flax and Teal worked extremely well with all stakeholders, including the design and client teams to fully understand the project and co-create requirements. Always ensuring realistic, achievable and technical expectations. They are an extremely responsive team and always willing to help during challenging parts of the project, including unforeseen requirement changes and bugs/development issues. Phil&rsquo;s Kubernetes, data and architecture expertise has allowed us to deliver a much needed health product to time and to spec within a supportive and collaborative environment.
